//
// We expect that clients of the Android Bus Daemon Service will ask the
// Android runtime to instantiate the service using an Intent.  When the
// daemon service is installed (cf. adb install), the Android system notices
// that our service has the following lines in its AndroidManifest.xml:
//
//  <intent-filter>
//      <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
//      <action android:name="org.alljoyn.bus.daemonservice.START_DAEMON" />
//  </intent-filter>
//
// This tells the system that our Service can respond to the START_DAEMON
// action.  We expect an application Activity to create an Intent with an
// action of that name and ask for a service to be instantiated that can
// deal with that action, as in the following code:
//
//     Intent intent = new Intent("org.alljoyn.bus.daemonservice.START_DAEMON");
//     this.startService(intent);
//
// The Android system will, in response to the startService() call, create a
// process for our service, launch it and call our onStartCommand() method.
// (We require a 2.0 or greater platform to enable this behavior so we can
// return START_STICKY.  This means that our service must be explicitly stopped
// and will therefore run for arbitrary lengths of time.
//
// Once a service has been started, the Android system will try to keep it
// running.  If we return START_STICKY, the service will be kept around until
// the system needs to kill it because of a low memory situation.
//
// The Android kernel includes what is called a Low Memory Killer that takes
// requests to reduce memory consumption.  For each request, it looks at a
// least recently used (LRU) process list and sends a SIGKILL to what it
// decides is the least important process based on what the process is doing.
// The upshot of this is that our service will really get no indication that
// it has been chosen as a victim for termination.  It will just be killed as
// dead as it would if the super-user did a kill -9.  Because of this, we
// don't bother with any user-land way to end the service.  We just expect
// end our lifecycle by being killed one way or another.
//
// The rules to decide which process is least important, and therefore when
// the service might be killed by the Low Memory Killer are fairly complex
// and follow a priority-based scheme.  The Android framework sends hints
// about the importance of a process through the oom_adj value of the
// process (this is a Linux thing -- see the Linux OOM Killer).
//
// Once a service has been started, it is considered less important than
// an application process that is visible to the user, but more important
// than non-visible application processes.  Since there are relatively few
// visible applications, services will generally not be killed except in
// *extreme* low memory situations.
//
// If this isn't good enough, there are a couple of ways to gain even more
// priority, though.  If the service puts itself into a foreground state
// by calling startForeground(), it is essentially immune from being killed.
// If a client binds to a service (this does put our existence in the hands
// of the client) the service inherits the clients visibility -- that
// is, the service is never less important than the most important client.
//
// The bottom line is that we really don't have to worry about being killed
// due to low memory problems.  Unused applications will go first.  If we
// do get killed, we will be whacked with SIGKILL and there's nothing we
// can do anyway since we can never know what is happening.
