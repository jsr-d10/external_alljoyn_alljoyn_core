     * This sets the debug level of the local AllJoyn daemon if that daemon
     * was built in debug mode.
     *
     * The debug level can be set for individual subsystems or for "ALL"
     * subsystems.  Common subsystems are "ALLJOYN" for core AllJoyn code,
     * "ALLJOYN_OBJ" for the sessions management code, "ALLJOYN_BT" for the
     * Bluetooth subsystem, "ALLJOYN_BTC" for the Bluetooth topology manager,
     * and "ALLJOYN_NS" for the TCP name services.  Debug levels for specific
     * subsystems override the setting for "ALL" subsystems.  For example if
     * "ALL" is set to 7, but "ALLJOYN_OBJ" is set to 1, then detailed debug
     * output will be generated for all subsystems expcept for "ALLJOYN_OBJ"
     * which will only generate high level debug output.  "ALL" defaults to 0
     * which is off, or no debug output.
     *
     * The debug output levels are actually a bit field that controls what
     * output is generated.  Those bit fields are described below:
     *
     *     - 0x1: High level debug prints (these debug printfs are not common)
     *     - 0x2: Normal debug prints (these debug printfs are common)
     *     - 0x4: Function call tracing (these debug printfs are used
     *            sporadically)
     *     - 0x8: Data dump (really only used in the "SOCKET" module - can
     *            generate a *lot* of output)
     *
     * Typically, when enabling debug for a subsystem, the level would be set
     * to 7 which enables High level debug, normal debug, and function call
     * tracing.  Setting the level 0, forces debug output to be off for the
     * specified subsystem.
     *
     * @param module    name of the module to generate debug output
     * @param level     debug level to set for the module
