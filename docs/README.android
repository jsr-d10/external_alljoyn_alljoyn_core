    The file and directory structure inside them is described below. 

 * ReleaseNotes
    New features, known issues, etc.


Summary of NDK file and directory structure:
----------------------------------------
 * In each copy of the AllJoyn SDK for Android (debug or release), five of
   the top-level directories support C++ application development within the
   Android NDK:

    ./alljoyn_android
        Contains the Alljoyn daemon project 
            alljoyn - The 'alljoyn' project is the AllJoyn.apk.  A precompiled 
                      binary of the AllJoyn.apk can be found in
                      ./alljoyn_android/alljoyn/bin            
        
    ./bin
        Executable binaries and prebuilt APK's (bus daemon, C++ samples, test programs)
        ./bin/bbdaemon
            Simplified bus daemon implementation:
                Needs no configuration files.
                Does not implement DBus policy rules.
        ./bin/alljoyn-daemon
            Full-featured bus daemon implementation:
                Requires configuration file.
                Implements DBus policy rules.
        ./bin/bbclient
            Bus client example.
        ./bin/bbservice
            Bus service example.
    
    ./docs
        AllJoyn C++ API (HTML documentation)

    ./inc
        AllJoyn C++ header files

    ./lib/liballjoyn.a
        Static library used to build AllJoyn capable applications.

    ./samples
        C++ sample programs for AllJoyn (see Developers Guide)

 * The remaining top-level directory (java) contains a similar structure
   underneath it, supporting the AllJoyn Java language binding:

    ./java/docs
        AllJoyn Java API (HTML documentation)

    ./java/jar
        alljoyn.jar, alljoyn_test.jar
        
    ./java/lib
        liballjoyn_java.so

    ./java/samples
        Java sample programs for AllJoyn (see README)
        Each sample contains a bin directory containing the prebuilt apks for 
        that sample.
