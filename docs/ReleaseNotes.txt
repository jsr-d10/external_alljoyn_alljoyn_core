AllJoyn Version 2.5.0 Release Notes
-----------------------------------

Platform Support
----------------
1) Linux Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit (x86-64)
2) Android Froyo 2.2 (ARM7)
3) Android Gingerbread 2.3.4 (ARM7)
4) Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 (ARM7)
4) Windows XP (32 bit x86)
5) Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit x86)


Features added in this release
------------------------------

Added support for ICE (IETF draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-19) based peer-to-peer
connections.  This new feature allows peers to connect over IP networks when
multicast is blocked or when 802.11 wireless isolation prevents the existing
AllJoyn discovery and connect mechanisms from succeeding.

Added an API (BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks) for controlling
concurrent method/signal handler callbacks. Previously, the AllJoyn client
library did not concurrently dispatch user-defined method/signal handlers.  It
did, however, concurrently dispatch certain AllJoyn control related callbacks
such as BusListener.FoundAdvertisedName, etc. These control related callbacks
are now under the control of the new EnableConcurrentCalbacks API.

Added new API BusAttachment.SetLinkTimeoutAsync. This new method is an
asynchronous form of the existing SetLinkTimeout call.

Added GoogleTest based test framework to automate the testing of the AllJoyn
core.


Issues Addressed in this Release
--------------------------------

ALLJOYN-829: Changing link timeout via SetLinkTimeout now takes effect
immediately. Previously, the link needed to receive at least one more message
before the change would take effect.

ALLJOYN-830: SetLinkTimeoutAsync was added to the external API to allow the user
to set the link timeout from within the SessionPortListener::SessionJoined (or
other AllJoyn) callback.

ALLJOYN-907: LostAdvertisedName indication is no longer delayed when the client
side disconnects prior to the service side.


Known issues and limitations with this release
----------------------------------------------

ALLJOYN-1154: The number of names that can be advertised from a single AllJoyn
daemon instance (either bundled or unbundled) over TCP is limited to about 1400
bytes.

ALLJOYN-1217: AllJoyn operation over Bluetooth is stable with up to 3
devices. Some instabilites are seen with 4 or more devices.

ALLJOYN-1228: Discovery times when using ICE / Rendezvous are sometimes longer
than necessary due to proximity scanning.

ALLJOYN-(various): Daemon crashes are possible when using the bundled version of
the AllJoyn daemon. Because of this, use of the bundled daemon is not officially
supported in 2.5.0

QA testing for the 2.5.0 release was completed only on Android variants of the
non-bundled daemon.


Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.
