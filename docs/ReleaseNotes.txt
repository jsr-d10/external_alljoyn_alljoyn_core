AllJoyn Version 2.5.1 Release Notes
-----------------------------------

Platform Support
----------------
1) Linux Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit (x86-64)
2) Android Froyo 2.2 (ARM7)
3) Android Gingerbread 2.3.4 (ARM7)
4) Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 (ARM7)
FIXME #### Windows is not supported


Features added in this release
------------------------------

FIXME #### Added support for ICE (IETF draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-19) based peer-to-peer
FIXME #### connections.  This new feature allows peers to connect over IP networks when
FIXME #### multicast is blocked or when 802.11 wireless isolation prevents the existing
FIXME #### AllJoyn discovery and connect mechanisms from succeeding.

FIXME #### Added an API (BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks) for controlling
FIXME #### concurrent method/signal handler callbacks. Previously, the AllJoyn client
FIXME #### library did not concurrently dispatch user-defined method/signal handlers.  It
FIXME #### did, however, concurrently dispatch certain AllJoyn control related callbacks
FIXME #### such as BusListener.FoundAdvertisedName, etc. These control related callbacks
FIXME #### are now under the control of the new EnableConcurrentCalbacks API.

FIXME #### Added new API BusAttachment.SetLinkTimeoutAsync. This new method is an
FIXME #### asynchronous form of the existing SetLinkTimeout call.

FIXME #### Added GoogleTest based test framework to automate the testing of the AllJoyn
FIXME #### core.


Issues Addressed in this Release
--------------------------------

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-829: Changing link timeout via SetLinkTimeout now takes effect
FIXME #### immediately. Previously, the link needed to receive at least one more message
FIXME #### before the change would take effect.

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-830: SetLinkTimeoutAsync was added to the external API to allow the user
FIXME #### to set the link timeout from within the SessionPortListener::SessionJoined (or
FIXME #### other AllJoyn) callback.

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-907: LostAdvertisedName indication is no longer delayed when the client
FIXME #### side disconnects prior to the service side.


Known issues and limitations with this release
----------------------------------------------

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-1154: The number of names that can be advertised from a single AllJoyn
FIXME #### daemon instance (either bundled or unbundled) over TCP is limited to about 1400
FIXME #### bytes.

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-1217: AllJoyn operation over Bluetooth is stable with up to 3
FIXME #### devices. Some instabilites are seen with 4 or more devices.

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-1228: Discovery times when using ICE / Rendezvous are sometimes longer
FIXME #### than necessary due to proximity scanning.

FIXME #### ALLJOYN-(various): Daemon crashes are possible when using the bundled version of
FIXME #### the AllJoyn daemon. Because of this, use of the bundled daemon is not officially
FIXME #### supported in 2.5.0

FIXME #### QA testing for the 2.5.0 release was completed only on Android variants of the
FIXME #### non-bundled daemon.


Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.
