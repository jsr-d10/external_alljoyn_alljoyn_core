AllJoyn Version 2.2.0 Release Notes
-----------------------------------

Platform Support
----------------
1) Linux Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit (x86-64)
2) Android Froyo 2.2 (ARM7)
3) Android Gingerbread 2.3.4 (ARM7)
4) Windows XP (32 bit x86)
5) Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit x86)

Features added in this release
------------------------------

1) Add security option to enforce Android manifest permissions.
   On Android, Alljoyn clients that want to access remote services must have
   INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE, BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
   manifest permissions.

2) Multipoint session authentications are now done in parallel rather
   than serially. As part of this change, peer authentications can now
   only be triggered by method calls. In previous releases, peer authentications
   could also be triggered by signals. This is no longer supported.

3) Added new callbacks (SessionMemberAdded and SessionMemberRemoved) to
   inform clients of multipoint session participant changes.

4) Added support for user-controlled link supervision timeout.  See
   BusAttachment::SetLinkTimeout().

5) AllJoyn daemon can now be bundled with an end-user application.
   This bundled daemon is a "last resort" in the case where neither
   a pre-installed nor a stand-alone APK version of the daemon can
   be located.

6) Added new method BusAttachment.release() which immediately frees
   all resources for a BusAttachment. Using this new method 
   avoids the possibility of consuming system resources while waiting
   for the Java garbage collector to finalize the BusAttachment.

7) Added BusAttachment::Set/GetKeyExpiration() to allow clients to
   interact more directly with the keystore.
 
8) Added support for Windows Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG).
   It's now possible to build AllJoyn on Windows without using the
   OpenSSL libraries.  Using CNG requires having Windows SDK 7.0 or 
   newer installed.  OpenSSL libraries are still required to build for
   Windows XP.


Issues Addressed in this Release
--------------------------------

1) ALLJOYN-580: The same AllJoyn binaries can now run on both Froyo and
   Gingerbread.

2) ALLJOYN-729: IPV6 based Advertising/Discovery is now working.

3) ALLJOYN-706: Simultaneous cross-joining between multiple devices now
   works as expected.

4) ALLJOYN-(various): Stability when using Bluetooth is greatly 
   improved


Known issues and limitations with this release
----------------------------------------------

1) ALLJOYN-557: Signals can be delivered twice when eavesdropping mode is
   enabled in the AllJoyn daemon.

2) ALLJOYN-829: Link timeout changes made via  BusAttachment::SetLinkTimeout()
   do not take effect until after the involved endpoints receive one more
   message with the original link timeout values.

3) ALLJOYN-830: SetLinkTimeout cannot be called from within the
   SessionPortListener::SessionJoined callback.


Compatibility
-------------
Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt
for use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not inter-operate
with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to
send messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the 
manifest permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach
external AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET,
CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE, BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model
of AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).
